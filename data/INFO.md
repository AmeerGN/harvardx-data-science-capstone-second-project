This directory is created to:
1. Save NSL-KDD dataset after downloading it from the Internet as `RData` file. In the next runs, the dataset will be loaded from this directory.
2. Save the trained classifiers each as `rds` file. In the next runs, the trained model will be loaded from this directory.
3. Save the predictions of each classifier as an `rds` file. In the next runs, the predictions will be loaded from this directory.

This way, the program will run efficiently and will focus on the analysis and results.
